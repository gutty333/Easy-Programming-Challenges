// For this challenge you will be converting a string of Roman numerals.
// have the function BasicRomanNumerals(str) read str which will be a string of Roman numerals. The numerals being used are: I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for 500 and M for 1000. In Roman numerals, to create a number like 11 you simply add a 1 after the 10, so you get XI. But to create a number like 19, you use the subtraction notation which is to add an I before an X or V (or add an X before an L or C). So 19 in Roman numerals is XIX.  The goal of your program is to return the decimal equivalent of the Roman numeral given.For example : if str is "XXIV" your program should return 24

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Not Finished

string BasicRomanNumerals(string str) 
{

}

int main()
{
	cout << BasicRomanNumerals("XXIV") << endl; // 24
	return 0;

}
